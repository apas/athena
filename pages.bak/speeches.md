## Pericles' Funeral Oration

I have dwelt upon the greatness of Athens [^1] because I want to show you that we are contending for a higher prize than those who enjoy none of these
privileges, and to establish by manifest proof the merit of these men whom I
am now commemorating. Their loftiest praise has been already spoken. For in
magnifying the city I have magnified them, and men like them whose virtues
made her glorious. And of how few Hellenes can it be said as of them, that
their deeds when weighed in the balance have been found equal to their fame!

I believe that a death such as theirs has been the true measure of a man's
worth; it may be the first revelation of his virtues, but is at any rate
their final seal. For even those who come short in other ways may justly
plead the valor with which they have fought for their country; they have
blotted out the evil with the good, and have benefited the state more by
their public services than they have injured her by their private actions.
None of these men were enervated by wealth or hesitated to resign the
pleasures of life; none of them put off the evil day in the hope, natural to
poverty, that a man, though poor, may one day become rich. But, deeming that
the punishment of their enemies was sweeter than any of these things, and
that they could fall in no nobler cause, they determined at the hazard of
their lives to be honorably avenged, and to leave the rest.

They resigned to hope their unknown chance of happiness; but in the face of death they
resolved to rely upon themselves alone. And when the moment came they were
minded to resist and suffer, rather than to fly and save their lives; they
ran away from the word of dishonor, but on the battlefield their feet stood
fast, and in an instant, at the height of their fortune, they passed away
from the scene, not of their fear, but of their glory.

## The Gettysburg Address

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. [^2]

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate — we can not consecrate — we can not hallow — this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us — that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion — that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain — that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

[^1]: This speech gives one of the best description of Athenian democracy and
ancient Athens. In the speech Pericles relates the special qualities of the
Athenians, redefining many traditional Greek value systems. The idea that the
Athenians are able to put aside their little wants and strive for the greater
good of the city is a central theme of the speech. The people of Athens
submit to the laws and obey the public officials not because they have to, as
in other cities, but because they want to. Athenians had thus achieved
something quite unique - being both ruled and rulers at one and the same time
(a first step toward democracy).

[^2]: On June 1, 1865, Senator Charles Sumner referred to the most famous
speech ever given by President Abraham Lincoln. In his eulogy on the slain
president, he called the Gettysburg Address a "monumental act." He said
Lincoln was mistaken that "the world will little note, nor long remember what
we say here." Rather, the Bostonian remarked, "The world noted at once what
he said, and will never cease to remember it. The battle itself was less
important than the speech."

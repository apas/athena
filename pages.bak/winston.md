# By Winston S. Churchill

When does one first begin to remember? When do the 
waving lights and shadows of dawning consciousness 
cast their print upon the mind of a child? My earliest mem 
ories are Ireland. I can recall scenes and events in Ireland 
quite well, and sometimes dimly even, people. Yet I was 
born on November 30, 1874, and I left Ireland early in the 
year 1879. My father had gone to Ireland as secretary to 
his father, the Duke of Marlborough, appointed Lord-Lieu 
tenant by Mr. Disraeli in 1876. We lived in a house called 
*The Little Lodge* about a stone's throw from the Vice
regal. Here I spent nearly three years of childhood. I 
have clear and vivid impressions of some events. I remem 
ber my grandfather, the Viceroy, unveiling the Lord Gough 
statue in 1878. A great black crowd, scarlet soldiers on horse 
back, strings pulling away a brown shiny sheet, the old 
Duke, the formidable grandpapa, talking loudly to the 
crowd. I recall even a phrase he used: 'and with a wither 
ing volley he shattered the enemy's line.' I quite under 
stood that he was speaking about war and fighting and that 
a Volley' meant what the black-coated soldiers (Riflemen) 
used to do with loud bangs so often in the Phoenix Park 
where I was taken for my morning walks. This, I think, is 
my first coherent memory. 

Other events stand out more distinctly. We were to go to 
a pantomime. There was great excitement about it. The long- 
looked-for afternoon arrived. We started from the Vice 
regal and drove to the Castle where other children were no 
doubt to be picked up. Inside the Castle was a great square space paved with small oblong stones. It rained. It nearly 
always rained just as it does now. People came out of 
the doors of the Castle, and there seemed to be much stir. 
Then we were told we could not go to the pantomime be 
cause the theatre had been burned down. All that was found 
of the manager was the keys that had been in his pocket. 
We were promised as a consolation for not going to the 
pantomime to go next day and see the ruins of the building. 
I wanted very much to see the keys, but this request does 
not seem to have been well received. 

In one of these years we paid a visit to Emo Park, the 
seat of Lord Portarlington, who was explained to me as a 
sort of uncle. Of this place I can give very clear descrip 
tions, though I have never been there since I was four or 
four and a half. The central point in my memory is a tall 
white stone tower which we reached after a considerable 
drive. I was told it had been blown up by Oliver Cromwell. 
I understood definitely that he had blown up all sorts of 
things and was therefore a very great man. 

My nurse, Mrs. Everest, was nervous about the Fenians. 
I gathered these were wicked people and there was no end 
to what they would do if they had their way. On one occa 
sion when I was out riding on my donkey, we thought we 
saw a long dark procession of Fenians approaching. I am 
sure now it must have been the Rifle Brigade out for a route 
march. But we were all very much alarmed, particularly the 
donkey, who expressed his anxiety by kicking. I was thrown 
off and had concussion of the brain. This was my first intro 
duction to Irish politics! 

In the Phoenix Park there was a great round clump of 
trees with a house inside it. In this house there lived a per 
sonage styled the Chief Secretary or the Under Secretary, 
I am not clear which. But at any rate from this house there 
came a man called Mr. Burke. He gave me a drum. I can 
not remember what he looked like, but I remember the 
drum. Two years afterwards when we were back in England, they told me he had been murdered by the Fenians in 
this same Phoenix Park we used to walk about in every day. 
Everyone round me seemed much upset about it, and I 
thought how lucky it was the Fenians had not got me when 
I fell off the donkey.

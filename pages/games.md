# Solo Projects

## [Office Rumpus](https://github.com/ThoseGrapefruits/Office-Rumpus)
> A 2D platformer in a small building environment with character control, functional elevators, and simple sprite animation built in Java using only the Graphics2D rendering system.

## [Tumbleweed Tango](http://www.flowlab.io/game/play/103175)
> A 2D soccer game for an introductory Game Design course at Northeastern University. Flowlab is still in beta, so there may be some unexpected behavior in the game as a result.
